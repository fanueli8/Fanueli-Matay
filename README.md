# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is a multi-page personal portfolio website created as part of Practical Assignment One. The site showcases my web development skills and projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to demonstrate industry best practices in structure, styling, and interactivity.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure with SEO-friendly elements
- **CSS3** – Styling using external, internal, and inline CSS
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Interactivity and DOM manipulation
- **W3C Validators** – Code validation for HTML and CSS
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and deployment (GitHub Pages)
- **Browser Developer Tools** – Debugging and layout testing

## Website Structure
The portfolio website includes the following pages:
1. **Homepage** – Brief introduction and greeting based on time of day
2. **About Me** – 2-column layout with bio, skills, and nested lists
3. **Portfolio/Projects** – 3-column layout with dynamic show/hide functionality
4. **Contact Form** – Validated form using JavaScript (email, phone number)
5. **Survey Page** – Includes radio buttons, checkboxes, text areas, and form validation

## Key Features
- **Semantic HTML5 Tags**: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, etc.
- **SEO Optimization**: Title and meta tags (description, keywords, author)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using media queries
- **Image & Media Integration**:

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
- **Responsive Layout**: Initially faced issues with mobile layout. Solved using Flexbox and media queries.
